The rainbow

It is a beautiful day outsiode.
It is alarmingly beautiful.
The rains have been incessant but there is sense of calm in the air. The days remind me of Mishima's beautiful picturesque descriptions
of Japanese Landscapes.
I have now added unicorn to my shortlist of bizarre creatures that I want to watch before I die. The problemis, I may also see a unicorn after I die which is quite funny.
